# 学习认字 (Xue Xi Ren Zi) WIP
The goal of this progam is to help keen learners improve their Chinese reading ability by recommending crawled news articles based on their level of knowledge.

## How to use:
1. Run *main.py* that can be found at the top-level directory.
2. Input the correct *pinyin* and its tone (e.g. xue2, xi2, ren4, zi4, ...) of the highlighted Chinese character as shown in the GUI.

Disclaimer: Although the app is currently functional, this project is not yet completed.
